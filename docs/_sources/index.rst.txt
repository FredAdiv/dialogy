Starting projects
**************************

We have a `template <https://github.com/Vernacular-ai/dialogy-template-simple-transformers>`_
that can help you get started with a SLU project.

.. code-block:: shell

   dialogy create <your_project_name> dialogy-template-simple-transformers

An interactive session will collect a few details and create a project scaffolding ready to use.
